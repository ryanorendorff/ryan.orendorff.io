    Hello, my name is Ryan Orendorff. I am currently a <span class="abbr">nsf grfp</span> funded PhD candidate in the
    Joint Bioengineering program at
    UC Berkeley/UCSF, working in the <a href="http://www.bisl.berkeley.edu">Berkeley Imaging Systems Laboratory</a>.
    I work on novel image reconstruction methods for magnetic particle imaging
    (<span class="abbr">mpi</span>) using convex optimization techniques. On the side, I do software consulting
    with the <a href="http://innolitics.com/">Innolitics</a> medical imaging software consulting firm.
  </p>

  <p>
  I spend most of my free time investigating new programming languages and type theory as these methods provide
  safety guarantees that a program will run as expected. The intersection of type theory and optimization is
  particularly potent; the optimization can guarantee a certain set of results will happen, while type theory
  allows one to express the mathematical model in a provably correct way in a computational setting.
  </p>

  <p>Previously I have worked at the following places.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>At the Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratory (<span class="abbr">merl</span>), I developed new algorithms
        for efficient model predictive control on constrained systems.</li>
    <li>At the National Center for Atmospheric Research (<span class="abbr">ncar</span>), I built a custom
        laser hygrometer to measure water concentration on aircraft platforms such as a C-130 and a Gulfstream
        5 jet. In this work I both designed and built the optics as well as the software stack used to control
        the device. I went on a three week field project in St. Croix to measure the effects of small particulates
        on cloud formation in the tropics
        (the <a href="https://www.eol.ucar.edu/field_projects/ice-t">ICE-T</a> project).</li>
  </ul>

  I have had the pleasure of attending the following universities.
  <ul>
    <li>Cambridge University. I was awarded a Cambridge Overseas Trust Scholarship to obtained a Masters of
        Philosophy by Research in Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology in the
        <a href="http://laser.ceb.cam.ac.uk/">Laser Analytics Group</a>.
        During my time, I investigated
        novel broadband cavity absorption spectroscopy designs for detecting europium in aqueous solutions.
        My thesis can be found here:
        <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/fimn1h5ovgbv58u/mphil_cam_orendorff.pdf?dl=0">pdf</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/ryanorendorff/masters_thesis">code</a>.</li>
    <li>Tufts University. At Tufts I pioneered new ways to use silk as an optical medium in the
        <a href="http://ase.tufts.edu/biomedical/unolab/home.html">Omenetto lab</a>. For my honors thesis
        I created a software framework for using the Microsoft Kinect as a platform for at home monitoring
        of patients after cardiac surgeries (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vrtncs2dhdl0qvb/esoma.pdf">pdf</a>).</li>
  </ul>
