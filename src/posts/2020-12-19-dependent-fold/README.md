Dependently Typed Fold Post
===========================

To run the code in this post, the included `run.sh` script can be used. It
required [Nix][nix] to be installed, which is used to fetch GHC and the
libraries listed below.

- clash-prelude
- ghcid

So if you have [Nix][nix], all you have to do is run

```
./run.sh
```

from this directory to execute the `DependentFold.lhs` file!
